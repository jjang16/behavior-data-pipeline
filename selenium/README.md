# behavior-data-pipeline 
## Selenium use case automation


### Running guide

To run it inside a browser (Chrome or Firefox, Chrome recommended), install a Selenium IDE browser extension and load a project using the `behavior-data-pipeline.side` file in this folder.

Press the play button to view the scenario.

For commands `set speed` and `set window size`, adjust to your needs accordingly (the speed is regulated in milliseconds of wait between commands, e.g. value of 3000 would wait for 3 seconds between each command). You can also just leave the default values in place.

I also recommend the following for the best visuals:

1. Dry run the test before presentation, maximize the window and zoom out slightly to prevent awkward scrolls.

2. Keep the window open after (1).
